# ðŸ“’ To-Do-Manager

## ðŸ“² Now let's see how this application works:

After downloading the application, a screen with tasks immediately appears. They can be important and current. It is worth noting that all tasks are stored in UserDefaults, so after closing the application, everything is saved.

<br />

Each task can be swiped left or right. A swipe to the left brings up a delete button, and a swipe to the right brings up a change button and a button to cancel a task if it's already marked as done.

Also on the main screen, you can click the edit button, which is located in the upper left corner. After clicking, we will be able to delete and swap tasks in places.

If on the main screen you click on the button for creating a new task in the upper right corner, you can get to the new screen for creating a task. There you can specify the name of the task, its type, whether it was completed or not. The task type is implemented on a different screen, each type has a detailed description.
